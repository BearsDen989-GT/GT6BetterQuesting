If you found such a rock, make sure to mark that position, it means there is a large vein of that type of ore below\n\n- Dungeon Loot and Villages can give you a nice early game boost and even can contain some valueable metals for later\n\n- Make sure that your base will be close to the ocean or a river or at least a large lake. You will need tons of water and only in those places water is infinite.\n\n- Read the tooltips, they contain valuable information, if you want even more info press F3+H to enable/disable advanced tooltips (it\u0027s really worth it)\n\n- Be careful with your food, if you eat too much of the same type (e.g. sugar, protein etc) in too short of a time, you get some effects. E.g. sugar makes you faster but if you eat too much you might get diabetes."

If you look in NEI you might see that some ingots/materials have something like Q: 2 S: 6.0 D: 256 (e.g iron) in their tooltip. Whenever a material has those 3 properties in their tooltip it means you can make a tool out of it and the tool will have those stats.\nQ stands for quality, which means the mining/harvesting level.\nS stands for speed, which is just as you already guessed the speed which you can mine/harvest blocks with\nD stands for durability and is the number of uses you can use the item. The real number will be D * 100 because each use costs 100 durability on average (harvesting harder materials costs more durability, softer materials cost less)\n\nYou might have also noticed the \"possible enchantments\" part in the tooltip. That means if you make a tool out of that material the tool will automatically be enchanted with those enchantments, isn\u0027t that great?"

Instead depending on the machine you have to hook up other machines that output different power types to your factory, kind of like a semi multiblock.\n§7§9§e§k§l§l§k§m§m§r§1§2§3§4§5§6§7§9\nE.g:\nLets say you have an Oven, instead of hooking up a cable directly to it you power it with Heat (HU). So you place a burning box or electric heater below it. In case of the electric heater you power this one with EU.\n\nNow lets give a more complex example:\nSay you are in the steam age and want to power your crusher for ore doubling.\nThe Crusher needs KU, which you get from an engine, which itself needs to be supplied with steam to work, the steam comes from a boiler, which needs HU to convert water to steam, so you place a burning box below the boiler.\n§f\nAll machines have a range in which they can work. If you supply less, it wont do anything and if you supply more than the max it either stops working or melts down or even explodes. Make sure to supply your machines inside their working range!\n\n\nSome explanation about recipes:\n\nCosts - the total cost the recipe costs in GU (the actual type depends on the specific machine, it will convert all other types into GU 1:1 internally)\nUsage - the minimum GU/t you have to supply, if you supply less, the machine will not be able to process the recipe and get stuck (if that happens, either supply the right amount of energy/t or use a rubber-hammer/harvest-and-replace the machine to reset it, the items for the recipes are lost this way though)\nTier\u0026Power are interesting for overclocking recipes (more of that in later ages)\nTime - the time the recipe takes to finish, given you supply the exact amount needed (if you supply more, the machine will finish faster)\n"
