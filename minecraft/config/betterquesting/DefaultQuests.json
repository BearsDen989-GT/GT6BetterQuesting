The easiest anvil is made from stone but only has 1 use. Making an anvil from black or red granite will last longer.  Later you can make one from your metals.  Place 2 ingots (I recommend bronze) on the anvil (one left, one right) hammer it and you get double ingot, use the anvil again and you get a plate and some scraps. You will need 8 plates for now.\n\nNow make a file using 2 of your plates.\n\nNext you will want make a wrench and you are almost ready to take on the world.\n\nFinally you will need a rolling pin.  You can make this from wood.  All you need is 1 plank and 2 sticks.\n\nNow you finally have the tools you need to make a crucible, which will be your first way to indirectly increase your ore output (when you cast plates they only cost 1 ingot worth of material, and rods only cost 0.5 ingots)\n§9\nNote:  You can make either a stone anvil, black granite anvil, or red granite anvil.  You can see these options by clicking the right arrow in the bottom right of the pane to the right.  The stone anvil will complete the quest but will break when you make your first plate.  I recommend to make a level 3 pick (red/black granite rocks) and mine some red/black granite stone to make the better anvils.\n§f\nTo complete this quest make the following:\n1 Hammer from rocks.\n1 Stone or Black Granite or Red Granite anvil\n1 File (recommend bronze or lead)\n1 Wrench (recommend bronze or lead)\n1 Rolling Pin *from wood plank and sticks)\n"

Craft the grass 3x3 to make grass bales and place them in the sun to let them dry (be sure they are somewhere dry and not right next to a lake or out in the rain, otherwise they will get moldy)\nWhen the bales are dry you can colelct them and then craft them back into 9 dry grass and make your fire starter.  You use 2 sticks and 1 dry grass to make a fire starter.  You might want to make multiple since we need more later anyway.\n\nYou may have noticed dead logs either laying on the ground or still standing around the landscape.  If you right click these with an axe, you will receive dry bark.  You can combine 2 sticks and the dried bar to create  a fire starter.  Be aware that fire starters do not stack so be careful filling your inventory with these. \n\nYour furnace can only melt a few ores like copper, tin/casserite, lead and bronze. For higher tier metals you need a crucible.  The furnace can still make galss from sand.\n\nMake the following:\n1 Flint Knife\n1 Bale of Grass\n1 Bale of Dried Grass\n1 Fire Starter\n1 Furnace\n"

To get access to those higher tier materials like iron and steel we need something generate and handle more heat.\n\nIt\u0027s time to get a crucible to go with the burning box that you just made.\n\nThe crucible (if placed above a lit burning box) will heat up continously and melt even the toughest of materials. But be careful, the material the crucible is made of determines the maximum temperature the crucible can take. Anything above and the crucible itself will melt down.\n\nFor now a ceramic crucible will be enough, it goes up to 2500K which is plenty for this technology age.\n\nAlso make some molds and a few crossings. You can place the molds directly next to the crucible without the crossings but the crossings allow you to use more molds at once. \n\n§cCareful: the molds themself also have a max temperature they can take, since our molds are also ceramic, they can take the same 2500K, so we are fine\n\n§f§rFor now you can use the Brick or Bronze Burning Box.  You can upgrade the burning box to higher heat output and/or more effecient materials and different fuel types later.  There are also different fuel type burning boxes.  There are solid fuel which is wood and coal, liquid ones which use liquid fuels such as cresote and gas ones that use gas fuels such as methane and hydrogen.  For now we will stick to solid fuel burning boxes.\n\nWhen using your burning box you will need to use a shovel to remove the dark ash waste.  Do that while it is running is likely to burn you.  You cna also use the shover to remove solid waste from the crucible is there are any leftovers.  1 scrap is 1 nuget of material.\n§c\nWarning:  When using the crucible, keep an eye on the temperature.  Right now make sure you use quick fuels such as wood or lignite coal.  As soon as the material in the crucible turns to liquid, put a block of sand, dirt or gravel infrom of the crucible.  Wait to make sure that the burning box stops burning before your pour your molds.  With little to no material in the crucible with heat very quickly and exceed the 2,500K temperature.  If it does the crucible will melt and if you are nearby, it will boil you to death.\n§f\nFor this quest make the following:\n1 Bronze or Lead Solid Burning Box\n1 Ceramic Crucible\n2 Ceramic Crossings\n4 Clay molds\n\nThere are 2 reqards\n2 Useful Books\nChoose a cookie (Use the right arrow below to get to the cookies and finish the quest)"

If you found such a rock, make sure to mark that position, it means there is a large vein of that type of ore below\n\n- Dungeon Loot and Villages can give you a nice early game boost and even can contain some valueable metals for later\n\n- Make sure that your base will be close to the ocean or a river or at least a large lake. You will need tons of water and only in those places water is infinite.\n\n- Read the tooltips, they contain valuable information, if you want even more info press F3+H to enable/disable advanced tooltips (it\u0027s really worth it)\n\n- Be careful with your food, if you eat too much of the same type (e.g. sugar, protein etc) in too short of a time, you get some effects. E.g. sugar makes you faster but if you eat too much you might get diabetes.\n\n- The area around spawn is mob spawn proof up to 128 blocks from spawn.  If you are looking for a safe place to start, start at spawn.  You can also make Greg\u0027s comsetic blocks from his stone or his dirt and these blocks are also prevent mods from spawning.\n\nClick the button to the right to continue."

The real number will be D * 100 because each use costs 100 durability on average (harvesting harder materials costs more durability, softer materials cost less)\n\nYou might have also noticed the \"possible enchantments\" part in the tooltip. That means if you make a tool out of that material the tool will automatically be enchanted with those enchantments, isn\u0027t that great?\n\nOne enchant is Fortune.

To get fortune you need the right material.  The first material is Soularium (9 soulsand dusts and 1 gold) in the crucible.  This will give Fortune I.  Later there is Efrine tools that give Fortune II.  The final material is Jade which will give you Fortune III.

If you can\u0027t find flint anywhere use rocks but you really want some flint for a knife,  Gather some sticks from the ground and pick up some stones.  If some of the rocks are ores, mark that location so you can come back later to mine the ore.  Ore bearing rocks indicate that there is an ore block somewhere below that rock location.  This is the primary way to find ore blocks.\n\n§cTip:  You can get flint from gravel.  Using your first piece of flint to make a shovel will make gathering garvel much faster.\n§f\nAll flint tools automatically get the fire aspect enchantment, which means huting for meat yields cooked meat!\n§b\nSome information aboujt rocks:\nAll rocks have a specific level due to the hardness of the rock.  This hardness will determine which rocks a pick axe can mine and the durability and how many uses that tool will have.\nFor example Minecraft stone, diorite, limestone and marble are all level 1 stones so you can mine with a level 1 pick axe or higher.  A level 1 pick axe is made of these same rocks or flint.\nLevel 2 stone such as Basalt, Komatite, or Kimberlite are level 2 rocks so if you want to mine these rocks, you will need a pick made of these rocks.\nLevel 3 stone such as Black Granite and Red Granite are level 3 rocks so if you want to mine these rocks, you will need a pick made of these rocks.  These rocks have the best durability of all stone tools.\n§4\nPro tip:  Make a hammer from 6 red/black granite and you can mine a piece of red/black granite.  This will give you red/black cobblestone.  Place that red/black cobble on the ground and mine wit with you hammer will result in 3-4 red/black granite rocks to make more level 3 tools. \n§f\nGoals:\nGather flint and rocks and make the following tools:\n1 Pickaxe from flint or rocks\n1 Axe from flint or rocks\n1 Shovel from flint or rocks"

Those hoppers are more tick friendly, so don\u0027t feel bad about using them.\nThe difference between the materials is how many slots each hopper contains.\nThe default version doesn\u0027t care about the order items are put into it, while the Queque version does care and only outputs them in the same order.\n§5\n§6§5§6Tip: If you use a screwdriver you can set the hopper to only pull/push a certain amount of items. They also react to redstone to enable/disable their pull/push.\n\nPro Tip:  Make a Vanilla Minecraft Chest (these don\u0027t burn) and place the hopper below your bruning box with the hopper going into the chest.  This will allow for your dark ash to empty out of the burning box and end up in the chest.  This will prevent the burning box from going out due to being full of ash.  Just make sure to empty your chest once a while to prevent it from filling up and backing ash back to your burning box.\n§f\nCraft the following item:\n1 Bronze Hopper"

Later you get cheap rubber pipes, where this wont be much of a problem anymore!\n\nTo get started we need some iron. Greg has changed how black sand works from earlier version of GT6.  Greg added Basaltic, and Granitic Black Sand as blocks.  First you will need to convert the sand blocks into the resulting dusts which are labeled as Mineral Sand.  This is very easy.  Just put it into your black sand blocks in your crafting grid and pull out the 9 mineral sand dusts.  Mix some basaltic or granitic mineral sand with a carbon source (coal and coal coke work great for that.  You can use other ores for iron but in the case of limonite or hematite you need to add some calcite (limestone works good for that).\n\n§9Pro Tip:  You can use a GT barrel and put in 1 mineral sand dust.  Now when you put in additional blocks, they will be converted to the dusts automatically.\n\n§c\nCareful: Don\u0027t use lignite coal in the crucible, it will ignite and blow up. Use normal coal or coal coke.  You can use Lignit coal as fuel for the burning box.\n\nWarning:  Sifting Basaltic or Granitic Mineral Sand no longer give the resulting dusts.  They will give you some nuggets though.\n§f\nTo complete this quest you will need:\n14 Granitic or Basaltic Sand Dusts\n3 Carbon - You get the 3 carbon from 6 Crushed, Purified or gem Coal or 3 coal coke ingots.\nthen make 6 iron ingots using the crucible."

Since burning boxes need air in front of them to work, when the piston extends it will stop burning.\n\nNow connect the sensor with the piston, using the red alloy wire (you might want to use a wire cutter to make it easier).  you can put a lever on the piston to manually trigger the piston to shutoff the burning box.\n\nDone, you now have an auto shutoff for your crucible :)\n\nThere are multiple ways to build these systems.  One would be to bury the biston 2 blocks below and 1 block in front of the burning box and to use glass on top of the piston.  That way when the piston is actrivated, you can look through the glass to see when the burning box stops burning.\n\n§c§4§c\nCareful: a burning box will always finish burning it\u0027s current fuel item, that means it\u0027s best to use short burning time fuels like nuggets or tiny/small dusts.

Instead depending on the machine you have to hook up other machines that output different power types to your factory, kind of like a semi multiblock.\n§7§9§e§k§l§l§k§m§m§r§1§2§3§4§5§6§7§9\nE.g:\nLets say you have an Oven, instead of hooking up a cable directly to it you power it with Heat (HU). So you place a burning box or electric heater below it. In case of the electric heater you power this one with EU.\n\nNow lets give a more complex example:\nSay you are in the steam age and want to power your crusher for ore doubling.\nThe Crusher needs KU, which you get from an engine, which itself needs to be supplied with steam to work, the steam comes from a boiler, which needs HU to convert water to steam, so you place a burning box below the boiler.\n§f\nAll machines have a range in which they can work. If you supply less, it wont do anything and if you supply more than the max it either stops working or melts down or even explodes. Make sure to supply your machines inside their working range!\n\n\nSome explanation about recipes:\n\nCosts - the total cost the recipe costs in GU (the actual type depends on the specific machine, it will convert all other types into GU 1:1 internally)\nUsage - the minimum GU/t you have to supply, if you supply less, the machine will not be able to process the recipe and get stuck (if that happens, either supply the right amount of energy/t or use a rubber-hammer/harvest-and-replace the machine to reset it, the items for the recipes are lost this way though)\nTier\u0026Power are interesting for overclocking recipes (more of that in later ages)\nTime - the time the recipe takes to finish, given you supply the exact amount needed (if you supply more, the machine will finish faster)\n"

It also allows you to use your liquid metal before is solidifies in your crucible.  A soft hammer will be useful when making items out of wood like your first pipes.  Finally a pair of wire cutters will be useful to make some wire for machines and dealing with redstone alloy wires needed for automation.\n§d\nPro Tip:  You can make a mold of your saw and screwdriver using the tool and a clay mold.  If you use the completed tool, the tool wil ltake some durability damage but will not be consumed.  If you use just hte tool head, it will be comsumed when making a mold.

So how do we get mercury?\n\nWe get mercury from Cinnabar ore.  Cinnabar is found in the same vein as redstone.  So if you found a redstone vein, there is most likely cinnabar there too.  You will need a level 2 pick to mine the cinnabar ore.  So mine down to the Redstone Cinnabar vein.  Near the top of the vein there should be small cinnabar ores.  These are the ones that you want.  You are looking to gather 3 crushed cinnabar ores.  Each crushed Cinnabar ore makes 3 nuggets of mercury.  White you are there gather some small restone ores as they will be needed soon.\n§e§e§c\n§9§f§eNote:  If you cannot find Cinnabar Ore, you can wash Crushed Redstone in a cauldon and get purified cinnabar ore for the recipe.\n§f\nOnce you have gathered the 3 crushed cinnabar ores (maybe gather a few more incase something goes wrong), you will need to get the mercury from the crushed ore.  Mercury is an interesting metal.  It is liquid at room temperature.  So Gregtech 6 gives you 2 options to get the mercury:\n\nFirst you can put 3 cinnabar crushed ores in a crucible.  Use a shovel to remove the scrap stone.  Once you start to get scrap mercury, put the mercury back in the crucible.  Next use 1 stick and light the burning box.  This should give you the mercury.  \n\nSecond you can put the 3 crushed cinnabar ores in a vanilla furnace.  Once you smelt the ore, you should get 9 nuggets of mercury.  Now take the 9 nuggets of mercury and drop them into the crucible.  The nuggests will turn to liquid immediately and you do not need to light the burning box.\n\n\nThe final step is to use a glass bottle and right-click the crucible to capture the mercury.  Be careful to not continue to right-click because you could drink the mercury (As Greg himself found out one day).  If you drink the mercury, you are likely to die from mercury poisoning.\n\nGet the following items:\n1 Glass Bottle\n3 Crushed Cinnabar Ores\n1 Mercury Bottle"
